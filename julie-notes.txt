The contact-card-project-v.2 uses a conditional for the Contact Form to add & edit contacts. The addContact.js and editContact.js still exists in this project for reference if you were to not use conditionals and add those components into index.js instead.
For this project, you will need to edit (7 files):
* flux.js 
    - create a variable for the api url & the slug/user name
    - add actions: getContacts, addContact, editContact, deleteContact, addUser
* appContext.js (state.actions.getContacts(); in the useEffect)
* ContactCard.js that will be used for each contact in the store that is mapped (w/ edit and delete buttons)
* home.js to import your ContactCard
* either ContactForm.js in the component folder OR 2 pages for add and editContact in the views folder 
* layout.js (routing for adding and editing contact)
* Modal.js (you can use this modal for handling deleting contacts in the ContactCard.js)

It also has a addSlug function attached if your slug name has been erased without your knowledge on the 4Geeks API.

* Only call the addUser if you get a specific response back that says your user is missing/not found??? or call the whole fetch actions and if you're username is not in the list, then go ahead and add it?
